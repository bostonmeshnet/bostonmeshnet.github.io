## What is Mesh Networking?

Mesh networking is a way of distributing bandwidth over an area. We distribute bandwidth by making line-of-sight connections between radio antennae stationed on rooftops. From each node, people are able to connect to the network like they would any other WiFi access point.

## Who Are We

BostonMesh is a community owned and operated mesh network consisting of many nodes spread throughout the city. Nodes connect securely (aka "mesh") using open, secure technologies like [cjdns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cjdns).

## Our Mission

We aim to create a free, resilient, stand-alone communication system that serves both for daily use and also for emergencies, such as power outages or internet disruptionâ€”running software. Our mesh network builds community with hyperlocal maps, events, and other applications.
